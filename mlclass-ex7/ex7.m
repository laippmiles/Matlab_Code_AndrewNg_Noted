%% ================= Part 1: Find Closest Centroids ====================
%  To help you implement K-Means, we have divided the learning algorithm 
%  into two functions -- findClosestCentroids and computeCentroids. In this
%  part, you shoudl complete the code in the findClosestCentroids function. 
%
fprintf('Finding closest centroids.\n\n');

% Load an example dataset that we will be using
X =load('ex7data2.csv');

% Select an initial set of centroids
K = 3; % 3 Centroids
%聚为3类
initial_centroids = [3 3; 6 2; 8 5];
%设定三个初始聚类簇核心
% Find the closest centroids for the examples using the
% initial_centroids
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, initial_centroids);

fprintf('Closest centroids for the first 3 examples: \n')
fprintf(' %d', idx(1:3));
fprintf('\n(the closest centroids should be 1, 3, 2 respectively)\n');

%% ===================== Part 2: Compute Means =========================
%  After implementing the closest centroids function, you should now
%  complete the computeCentroids function.
%
fprintf('\nComputing centroids means.\n\n');

%  Compute means based on the closest centroids found in the previous part.
centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K);

fprintf('Centroids computed after initial finding of closest centroids: \n')
fprintf(' %f %f \n' , centroids');
fprintf('\n(the centroids should be\n');
fprintf('   [ 2.428301 3.157924 ]\n');
fprintf('   [ 5.813503 2.633656 ]\n');
fprintf('   [ 7.119387 3.616684 ]\n\n');

%% =================== Part 3: K-Means Clustering ======================
%  After you have completed the two functions computeCentroids and
%  findClosestCentroids, you have all the necessary pieces to run the
%  kMeans algorithm. In this part, you will run the K-Means algorithm on
%  the example dataset we have provided. 
%
fprintf('\nRunning K-Means clustering on example dataset.\n\n');

% Load an example dataset
% Settings for running K-Means
max_iters = 10;

% For consistency, here we set centroids to specific values
% but in practice you want to generate them automatically, such as by
% settings them to be random examples (as can be seen in
% kMeansInitCentroids).
% Run K-Means algorithm. The 'true' at the end tells our function to plot
% the progress of K-Means
[~, ~] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters, true);
%最后一个参数决定是否开pause自己看聚类全过程
fprintf('\nK-Means Done.\n\n');

%% ============= Part 4: K-Means Clustering on Pixels ===============
%  In this exercise, you will use K-Means to compress an image. To do this,
%  you will first run K-Means on the colors of the pixels in the image and
%  then you will map each pixel on to it's closest centroid.
%  
%  You should now complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m
%K-mean聚类用在图片处理中
%本例将真彩色（255）转换成16色

fprintf('\nRunning K-Means clustering on pixels from an image.\n\n');

%  Load an image of a bird
A = double(imread('bird_small.png'));
% If imread does not work for you, you can try instead
%   load ('bird_small.mat');

A = A / 255; % Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1
%A本身元素取值是0-255.除个255即可归一化
% Size of the image
img_size = size(A);
%因为示例图是真彩色图片，出来的是N*N*3的多维数组
% Reshape the image into an Nx3 matrix where N = number of pixels.
% Each row will contain the Red, Green and Blue pixel values
% This gives us our dataset matrix X that we will use K-Means on.
X = reshape(A, img_size(1) * img_size(2), 3);
%A三页数组上下叠起来组成X
% Run your K-Means algorithm on this data
% You should try different values of K and max_iters here
%设定聚类类
K = 16; 
max_iters = 10;

% When using K-Means, it is important the initialize the centroids
% randomly. 
% You should complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m before proceeding
initial_centroids = zeros(K, size(X, 2));
% Run K-Means
[centroids, ~] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters, true);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;


%% ================= Part 5: Image Compression ======================
%  In this part of the exercise, you will use the clusters of K-Means to
%  compress an image. To do this, we first find the closest clusters for
%  each example. After that, we 

fprintf('\nApplying K-Means to compress an image.\n\n');

% Find closest cluster members
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids);

% Essentially, now we have represented the image X as in terms of the
% indices in idx. 

% We can now recover the image from the indices (idx) by mapping each pixel
% (specified by it's index in idx) to the centroid value
X_recovered = centroids(idx,:);
%一种mapping的写法，有点绕
%做个简单的示例：
%A = [3 2 1]

%B = [1 2 3
%     4 5 6
%     7 8 9]

% C = B(A',:)或C = B(A,:)都等于
% B = [7 8 9
%      4 5 6
%      1 2 3]
% Reshape the recovered image into proper dimensions
X_recovered = reshape(X_recovered, img_size(1), img_size(2), 3);

% Display the original image 
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imagesc(A); 
title('Original');

% Display compressed image side by side
subplot(1, 2, 2);
imagesc(X_recovered)
title(sprintf('Compressed, with %d colors.', K));


fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;
